## Our Work: Ghent House

This historical Ghent rowhouse, circa 1896, we renovated using period-correct materials and methods. Hammond Carpentry consulted closely with the owners and other trades throughout the design and execution of this project. We performed structural repairs, design and layout, weighted-sash window repairs, wall and ceiling straightening, heart-pine floor repair and installation, and custom interior trim design and installation.
